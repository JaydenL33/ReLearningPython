# ReLearningPython
Just me ReLearning Python and to be used as a reference for any python activities. 

## Getting Started 
A lot of this is actually developed from and created from examples for Automate the boring stuff with Python plus some stuff from external references with them all being listened in EndNote and specific information in a OneNote Book.
